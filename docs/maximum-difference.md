## Finding the Maximum Difference
---
Given a set of numbers, find the maximum difference between two numbers where order matters (i.e. one must come _before_ the other).
Examples are finding the highest temperature increase, or looking for the most profit on stock prices.

### Important Thoughts
  * **The highest number will not necessarily be included.**
     * Example: [12, 5, 7, 8, 11, 9]   --> maximum difference is between **5** and **11** (not 12 and 5)
  * **The lowest number will not necessarily be included.**
     * Example: [12, 5, 7, 8, 11, 4]   --> maximum difference is between **5** and **11** (not 12 and 4)
